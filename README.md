<h1>4. Key EDA findings </h1>
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
We first checked for null and duplicated rows within our datasets. Then, based on olist_datadict.xlsx metadata, we checked and corrected the datasets such that it not only correlates with olist_datadict.xlsx, but also makes merging and future data alterations easy and clear.
<h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
Our feature engineering boils down to five core customer signals:
Recency
 How recently someone shopped: we calculate the number of days between today (our reference date) and each customer’s most recent purchase. Shorter gaps → more engaged.


Frequency
 How often they buy: we count the distinct orders each customer placed in the six-month window. More orders → higher loyalty.


Monetary
 How much they spend: we sum up their order values (total spend) and divide by order count (average basket size) over that same period. Big spenders and consistent basket sizes are prime targets.


Behaviour
 • Delivery – for each order we flag on-time vs late and measure shipping delay in days, then average per customer to get an on-time ratio and mean/variance of delay.
 • Reviews – we join in all review scores, then compute each customer’s average rating and review count. Positive feedback and active reviewers tend to return.


Target
 Our binary label: did the customer make more than one purchase? Customers with ≥2 orders are marked “returning,” and that flag is what our model learns to predict.


Together, these five signals capture when, how often, how much, how well, and whether again—the exact dimensions needed to spot your next repeat buyer.
<h2>Insights found</h2>
The following are insights found from our Power BI analysis, refer to our dashboard and slides for additional information: <br>
1. Returning customers(0.11 in Q1) are more likely to pay with vouchers as compared to non returning customers (0.05). <br>
2. Returning customers (Approx. 1.3 in Q1) tend to order more items as compared to non returning customers (Approx. 1.2 in Q1).
3.Returning customers are slightly more satisfied than non returning customers. 63% of returning voted for 5 star reviews, while only 57% on non-returning

<h1>7. Choice of Model</h1>
For our model, we decided to use XGBoost and Random Forest. As our scenario is a binary class classification problem (Returning Customer or Non-returning customer), regression models like linear regression would not work as well. <br>
Random Forest is well suited for large datasets (90k data), and is more resistant to overfitting. <br>
XGBoost is not only great for non-linear relationships, but also provides feature importance as well, allowing us to evaluate which feature provided the most value. This feature creates a transparent model.  XGBoost is also scalable and handles large amount of data well.<br>

<h1>8. Model Evaluation </h1>
We decided to focus on overall accuracy, weighted precision, weighted recall and weighted f1 score as there is a huge imbalance between non returning and returning customers. The use of the weighted matrix allows us to account for the imbalance and hence is a better matrix to use. <br>
<h2>For Random Forest: </h2><br>
Overall Accuracy: 0.94<br>
Weighted Precision: 0.95 <br>
Weighted Recall: 0.94<br>
Weighted F1 Score: 0.49<br>

<h2>For XGBoost: </h2><br>
Overall Accuracy: 0.94 <br>
Weighted Precision: 0.91<br>
Weighted Recall: 0.94<br>
Weighted F1 Score: 0.92<br>


From this, we can see that our model can reliably differentiate between returning and non returning customers as the accuracy shown above is >90%. <br>
